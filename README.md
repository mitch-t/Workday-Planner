# Workday-Planner
My objective is to create a day planner with hour time blocks. The user will be 
shown today's date and nine one hour blocks. The user will be 
able to type their schedule into the planner and the schedule will
be saved to local storage, so everytime the user opens the planner their
schedule will be presented. The past blocks will be colored grey.
The present hour blocks will be red and the future blocks will be colored green.
